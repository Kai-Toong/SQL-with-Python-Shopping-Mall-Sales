# SQL-with-Python-Shopping-Mall-Sales
The dataset contains shopping information from 10 different shopping malls in Istanbul between 2021 January and 2023 March. This project aims to explore the dataset using SQL on Jupyter to answer various business questions. E.g Which age group/month/product category contributes to the most or least sales of the shopping mall?
